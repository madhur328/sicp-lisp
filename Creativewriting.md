Shelter your dreams before they become victims of a judging society!
Short Story
I left bits and pieces of my soul at the places where I left my dreams unfinished.

Am I building a graveyard for my dreams?

How can I abandon these little children before ensuring that they can reach their home safely?

Was it not up to me to ensure their safety?

The tiny angels that light up my World,

I should always keep them safe.
I will try and protect them from the judging eyes of others, I will protect them from the surgical dissection knifes of logic of those people -- that want to understand the things that they cannot hope to control by analyzing.

I know that I want to save all of my dreams -- Or, if it's beyond my ability to protect them -- I want to at least protect the ones that I can -- while grieving for the ones I could not;

For I cannot choose which promises are kept (promises are mutual), but I can definitely choose which regrets do I keep (my pain belongs to me alone unless someone wants to share it with themselves).

New Contents are now:

Every person who is a puppet of his Fate can cry victim-victim,

But, only a select few people -- the heroes of their own life, the masters and controllers of their own fate : the ones who have awakened their destiny and actively work towards it -- can truly inspire others with their inspiring story that makes the world a better place, while reducing human sufferings, end wars or world hunger once and for all.

Loud should not be your microphone when crying injustice;

Loud should be your actions in the "Silence of people trying to justify their unjust actions"; for forgiveness is the way going forward towards a better tomorrow.

"I left bits and pieces of my soul at the places where I left my dreams unfinished."

Ok man, but what stops you from continuing now,

chasing after the skies you have lost?

promises and regrets are one thing,

but if you were the final Light Keeper, the final guardian of the final gate -- which everyone is, just as you are -- and you see your life's work being destroyed, by people who feel victimized,

can you, for the greater good, sacrifice yourself for the future generations?

or would you, just like everybody else does, would like to keep stealing away from the children by leaving for them a World where they have no reason to continue chasing their Dreams?

The final lighthouse may burn one day...with all hope thus lost,

But think not thus, of the pain you hide, of the demons you battle,

think only about leaving a legacy - to the innocent children of the World.

Think thus that, "I will be burned by this fire"

But the fire, "Will it Inspire?"
